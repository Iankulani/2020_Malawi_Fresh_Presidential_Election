# 2020_Malawi_Fresh_Presidential_Election
This software prompts the user to enter total number of published centers, total number of registered votes, total number of null and void votes, total number of valid votes and total valid votes for each candidate. Afterward,it determines the candidate with the majority of votes and displays the results on the screen.

In May 2019, Malawi stood on the brink of a historic election that promised change and progress. 
However, the reality was far from hopeful. As the ballots were cast, reports of rampant rigging emerged, with officials allegedly using Tippex to alter results. This blatant manipulation ignited outrage across the nation, leading to widespread demonstrations in the streets. Citizens rallied for justice, their voices rising in unison against election rigging and electoral fraud.

The tension reached a boiling point, prompting the High Court to intervene. After a thorough review, the court ruled that the election was invalid and mandated a new election within 150 days. 
This decision breathed new life into the hopes of Malawians, who longed for a fair electoral process.

In the wake of this turmoil, a group of innovative developers saw an opportunity to effect change. 
They embarked on a mission to create a revolutionary software system designed to enhance electoral integrity. 
The software prompts users to enter total valid votes for all candidates, total null and void votes, and the overall valid votes. 
After processing this data, it accurately determines the majority winner, eliminating ambiguity and reducing the potential for fraud.

But this was not just a solution for Malawi. The developers envisioned their software as a tool that could be adapted for use in other countries with similar electoral challenges. 
With its user-friendly interface and robust functionality, the system promised to safeguard democracy wherever it was deployed.
